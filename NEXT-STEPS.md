# Next Steps - Subscription Sync Fix

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

1. **Enhanced webhook logging** - All webhook events now log complete payload structure
2. **Robust error handling** - Database errors are captured with full diagnostic details
3. **Improved fallback sync** - Payment handler has better subscription fetching with detailed logs
4. **Manual sync script** - Created tool to manually sync customer subscriptions
5. **Admin debug endpoint** - Added `/api/admin/webhook-debug` for monitoring webhooks
6. **Documentation** - Complete guides for troubleshooting and recovery

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Set Up Local Environment (For Manual Sync)

You have two options:

#### Option A: Pull from Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.local
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup
Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root with your environment variables.
See `scripts/setup-env.md` for detailed instructions.

### 2. Sync Sasi Kumar's Subscription

Once environment is set up, run:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/sync-subscription-by-customer.ts sasikumarkudimi@gmail.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- ‚úÖ Customer found
- üì¶ API response showing subscription data
- ‚úÖ Subscription synced to database
- üéâ Success message

### 3. Deploy Enhanced Webhook Handler

Deploy the updated code to Vercel:

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Enhanced webhook logging and subscription sync"

# Push to deploy (if auto-deploy is enabled)
git push origin main

# OR deploy directly with Vercel CLI
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Monitor Next Webhook Event

After deployment:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Logs
2. Wait for the next webhook event (or trigger a test payment)
3. Look for the detailed logs we added:
   - `[Webhook] Full event payload:`
   - `[Webhook] Subscription fields:`
   - `[Webhook] Upserting subscription with data:`
   - `[Webhook] Subscription synced successfully`

## üîç Debugging Tools Available

### 1. Webhook Debug Endpoint

View recent webhook events:
```
GET https://your-domain.com/api/admin/webhook-debug
GET https://your-domain.com/api/admin/webhook-debug?failed_only=true
GET https://your-domain.com/api/admin/webhook-debug?event_type=subscription.active
```

### 2. Vercel Logs

Monitor real-time logs:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Deployments > Latest > Functions
4. Click on the webhook function to see logs

### 3. Supabase Database

Check webhook events table:
```sql
-- View recent webhook events
SELECT * FROM dodo_webhook_events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- View failed events
SELECT * FROM dodo_webhook_events 
WHERE processed = false 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View subscriptions
SELECT * FROM subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = (
  SELECT user_id FROM customers 
  WHERE email = 'sasikumarkudimi@gmail.com'
);
```

## üìä What to Look For

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Webhook logs show complete payload
- ‚úÖ Database upsert returns data
- ‚úÖ No error messages in logs
- ‚úÖ User sees subscription in `/dashboard`

### Failure Indicators
- ‚ùå "Database upsert failed" in logs
- ‚ùå Missing required fields in subscription object
- ‚ùå Customer not found errors
- ‚ùå Empty subscription list from API

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Script fails with "supabaseUrl is required"
**Solution**: Create `.env.local` file with environment variables (see step 1 above)

### Issue: "No subscriptions found in DodoPayments"
**Solutions**:
1. Verify customer_id is correct in database
2. Check DodoPayments dashboard directly
3. Look at the full API response in logs

### Issue: "Database upsert failed"
**Solutions**:
1. Check the error code and hint in logs
2. Verify table schema matches expected structure
3. Check for missing required fields

### Issue: Subscription exists in Dodo but not syncing
**Solution**:
1. Run manual sync script for affected customer
2. Check webhook debug endpoint for failed events
3. Review detailed logs in Vercel for the actual error
