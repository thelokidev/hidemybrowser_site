- Supabase configured with auth providers (Magic Link, Google, GitHub)
- DodoPayments test environment configured
- Browser with dev tools open (for debugging)

---

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Logged Out User - Landing Page to Payment (Happy Path)

**Steps:**
1. **Clear browser state**
   - Open DevTools → Application → Clear all storage
   - Or use incognito/private window

2. **Navigate to landing page**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Verify page loads correctly

3. **Click "Get Monthly" button**
   - Expected: Redirects to `/pricing?plan=monthly`
   - Verify URL contains `?plan=monthly`

4. **Click "Get Monthly" again on pricing page**
   - Expected: Redirects to `/auth?next=%2Fpricing%3Fplan%3Dmonthly`
   - Verify URL encoding is correct

5. **Sign in with Magic Link**
   - Enter email address
   - Click "Send magic link"
   - Expected: Success message appears
   - Check email inbox for magic link

6. **Click magic link in email**
   - Expected: Redirects to `/auth/callback?next=%2Fpricing%3Fplan%3Dmonthly`
   - Then redirects to `/pricing?plan=monthly`
   - Payment modal should auto-open with embedded checkout iframe

7. **Verify payment modal**
   - Modal title: "Complete your purchase"
   - Iframe loads DodoPayments checkout
   - Can see payment form inside modal

8. **Complete or close payment**
   - Test closing modal (should close without errors)
   - Test completing payment (should redirect to `/dashboard?paid=1`)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Smooth redirects with preserved state
- ✅ Payment modal opens automatically after login
- ✅ User email pre-filled in checkout

---

### Scenario 2: Logged Out User - OAuth Sign In

**Steps:**
1. **Clear browser state**

2. **Navigate to `/pricing`**
   - Click any plan (e.g., "Get Weekly")

3. **Redirected to `/auth?next=%2Fpricing%3Fplan%3Dweekly`**

4. **Click "Continue with Google" or "Continue with GitHub"**
   - Complete OAuth flow in popup/redirect
   - Expected: Returns to `/auth/callback?next=%2Fpricing%3Fplan%3Dweekly`
   - Then redirects to `/pricing?plan=weekly`
   - Payment modal auto-opens

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ OAuth flow completes successfully
- ✅ Returns to correct pricing page with plan
- ✅ Payment modal opens for selected plan

---

### Scenario 3: Already Logged In User

**Steps:**

### Check Request Payloads
**POST /checkout should include:**
```json
{
  "product_cart": [
    {
      "product_id": "pdt_...",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "customer": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "User Name"
  },
  "return_url": "http://localhost:3000/dashboard?paid=1"
}
```

---

## Database Checks (Supabase Dashboard)

### After Successful Payment
1. **Check `subscriptions` table**
   - New row with `status: 'active'`
   - `user_id` matches logged-in user
   - `dodo_product_id` matches selected plan

2. **Check `dodo_webhook_events` table**
   - Events for subscription creation
   - `processed: true`

---

## Mobile/Responsive Testing

### Test on Different Screen Sizes
1. **Mobile (375px)**
   - Pricing cards stack vertically
   - Auth modal fits screen
   - Payment iframe scrollable

2. **Tablet (768px)**
   - 2-column pricing grid
   - Modals centered properly

3. **Desktop 1080p (1920x1080)**
   - 4-column pricing grid
   - Proper spacing (not too large)

4. **Desktop 1440p+ (2560x1440)**
   - Same layout as 1080p
   - Comfortable spacing

---

## Performance Checks

### Lighthouse Audit
- Run Lighthouse on `/pricing`
- Target scores:
  - Performance: > 90
  - Accessibility: > 95
  - Best Practices: > 90

### Load Times
- Initial page load: < 2s
- Auth redirect: < 1s
- Modal open: < 500ms
- Checkout iframe load: < 3s

---

## Security Checks

### Authentication
- ✅ Cannot access checkout without login
- ✅ Cannot bypass plan restrictions
- ✅ Session tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookies)
- ✅ No sensitive data in URL params (except encoded next)

### Payment
- ✅ Checkout happens in iframe (isolated)
- ✅ No credit card data touches your server
- ✅ Return URL validated server-side

---

## Automated Test Commands

### Run Unit Tests (if available)
```bash
npm test
```

### Run E2E Tests (if available)
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Type Check
```bash
npm run type-check
# or
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Lint Check
```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Plan parameter case sensitivity**
   - Uses `.toLowerCase().startsWith()` for matching
   - "monthly" matches "Monthly" plan

2. **Subscription loading state**
   - Brief "Checking subscription..." state on page load
   - Normal behavior, not a bug

3. **Modal iframe height**
   - Fixed at 640px
   - May need scrolling for some payment methods

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

1. **Revert landing page CTAs to direct checkout**
   ```tsx
   // In components/pricing.tsx
   onClick={() => handleCheckout(plan)}
   ```

2. **Disable auth gating temporarily**
   ```tsx
   // In app/pricing/page.tsx
   if (!authUser) {
     // Comment out redirect
     // window.location.href = `/auth?next=${next}`
   }
   ```

3. **Use external checkout (no modal)**
   ```tsx
   window.location.href = checkout_url
   ```

---

## Success Criteria

All scenarios pass with:
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Smooth user experience
- ✅ Correct redirects and state preservation
- ✅ Payment modal opens correctly
- ✅ Subscription restrictions enforced
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Fast load times
