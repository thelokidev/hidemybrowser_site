# Product ID Update Summary

## Problem
Updated environment variables in Vercel with new product IDs, but code was still using **hardcoded old product IDs**, causing checkout errors.

## Solution
Updated all files to:
1. Use environment variables from Vercel
2. Include fallback to new product IDs
3. Keep backward compatibility with old product IDs

## Files Updated

### 1. `app/pricing/page.tsx`
- ✅ Updated all 4 plan definitions to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_*`
- ✅ Fallback to new product IDs

### 2. `components/pricing.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `checkoutUrls` to use environment variables
- ✅ Fallback to new product IDs

### 3. `lib/dodopayments/checkout.ts`
- ✅ Updated `SUBSCRIPTION_PRODUCTS` to use environment variables
- ✅ Fallback to new product IDs

### 4. `lib/subscription-tier-utils.ts`
- ✅ Updated `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` to use environment variables
- ✅ Added `LEGACY_SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` for backward compatibility
- ✅ Updated `TIER_LEVELS` to support both old and new IDs
- ✅ Updated `TIER_NAMES` to support both old and new IDs

### 5. `components/subscription-status.tsx`
- ✅ Updated plan name mapping to support both old and new product IDs
- ✅ Backward compatible

### 6. `hooks/use-payment-status.ts`
- ✅ Updated `PRODUCT_PLANS` to support both old and new product IDs
- ✅ Backward compatible

### 7. `app/checkout/route.ts`
- ✅ Added diagnostic logging for configuration debugging

## Product ID Mappings

| Plan | Old ID | New ID |
|------|--------|--------|
| Weekly | pdt_v0slst9k4JI0Q2qUDkIAW | pdt_5ypSpqAzpNPQIBIw2Y66S |
| Monthly | pdt_ugqyKXMT219386BcoejVN | pdt_EUozfisbUTWeqXfagMOlc |
| 3 Months | pdt_W4YuF093U2MSpABbJ7miA | pdt_tmsm2z2gKcT5azrdecgyD |
| 6 Months | pdt_Ah7DRDitJbvGcaFMrqrOf | pdt_lq0xS7T3B921STb4Ys6D0 |

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_WEEKLY=pdt_5ypSpqAzpNPQIBIw2Y66S
NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_MONTHLY=pdt_EUozfisbUTWeqXfagMOlc
NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_3_MONTH=pdt_tmsm2z2gKcT5azrdecgyD
NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_6_MONTH=pdt_lq0xS7T3B921STb4Ys6D0
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=TSjfaqwJmyxmhwYM.QuB8YR0Ef0R2Y0krURuk9gaovmNre_mxhwbukvllmxD9mUQW
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode
DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_+imlo8s2twyEQpIOVVLC/CKdMQilfbWo
```

## How It Works Now

The code now follows this priority:
1. **First**: Try to read from environment variable (NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are available at build time)
2. **Fallback**: Use new hardcoded product ID if env var not set
3. **Backward Compatible**: All subscription/plan display logic supports both old and new IDs

This means:
- ✅ New checkouts will use the new product IDs from environment variables
- ✅ Existing subscriptions with old product IDs will still display correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes for existing users

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Deploy to Vercel** (or let auto-deploy happen)
3. **Test checkout** - try purchasing a plan
4. **Monitor logs** - check for the diagnostic log from `app/checkout/route.ts`

## Why the "Product does not exist" Error Occurred

The product IDs were hardcoded in the source code with the old values. When you updated environment variables in Vercel:
- ✅ Environment variables were updated in Vercel
- ❌ But the code wasn't reading them - it had hardcoded values
- The error happened because the code was trying to checkout with old product IDs

Now the code dynamically reads from environment variables, so future product ID changes only need to be updated in Vercel, not in the code.
